# CS50-2020

This is a git of my solution for Harvard CS50 2020 problem set

I will have about 2 versions of my code for each problem due to:
  1. My first code will be writen when I just follow what is taught in lecture
  2. Another edition will be writen when I rethink and review other people code and document for a more refine code
